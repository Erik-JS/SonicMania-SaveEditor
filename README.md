## Locating SaveData.bin

From your Steam install folder, go to `'userdata\«usernumber»\584400\remote'`.

## Note about Sonic Mania Plus / Encore DLC

As of version 1.04, all extra content is already included in the game's files and the game only checks if your account owns the DLC through Steam's API.

You may use this tool to set up Mighty and Ray on Mania Mode save slots even if you don't own the Encore DLC, but note that Encore content can only be accessed if you have the required DLC entitlement.

**DESIGNED FOR WINDOWS 7 OR LATER.**

**Always back up your SaveData.bin file before using this tool.**
